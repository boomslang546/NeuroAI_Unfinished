# In this project, ITK-SNAP was planned to be used for manual or semi-automated
# segmentation of key brain regions such as:
# - Substantia Nigra
# - Thalamus
# - Basal Ganglia

# The masks generated from these segmentations would be used to extract
# region-specific voxel intensities for more targeted machine learning input features.

# Integration with ITK-SNAP was not implemented in this version but remains a future goal.
